"""
11-Step Rule Extraction Pipeline (Two-Pass Architecture) with Learning Loop
============================================================================
Pass 0 (NEW):  Check for golden rules — if verified rules exist for this
               carrier, use them directly (skip extraction entirely)
Pass 1 (Steps 1-10): Extract candidate rules via Claude
Pass 1.5 (NEW): Sanity checks on extracted rules
Pass 2 (Step 10.5):  Validate & classify rules via Claude (with few-shot learning)
Step 11:             Output final validated rules
Post (NEW):    Offer to save validated rules as golden rules for next time

This architecture works for ANY carrier spec without
hardcoded field lists or keyword-based filtering.
